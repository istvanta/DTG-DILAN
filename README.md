# DTG - Dilan's Travel Guide
Here is my first hobby project which was my final exam task of Junior Data Science bootcamp.
Dilan needed some advice to develop his online business in order to reach more readers and customers.
This project contains three pdf files (1. Data downloading, automatation and data processing, 2. Readers and Customers segmentation, 3. Final Presentation - Performance Report) and one DBGate file with the queries.
